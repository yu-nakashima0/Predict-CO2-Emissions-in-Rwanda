Missing Values:
    -Mean, Median and Mode Imputation:
        df[i].fillna(df[i].mean())
        df[i].fillna(df[i].median())
        df[i].fillna(df[i].mode())
        +Advantages: Simple
        -Disadvantages: Inaccuracy
    -Forward and Backward Fill(It replaces missing values with the last observed non-missing value in the column):
        df[i].fillna(method='ffill')
        df[i].fillna(method='bfill')
        +Advantages: Simple and Intuitive, Preserves Patterns
        -Disadvantages: Assumption of Closeness, Potential Inaccuracy
    -Interpolation Techniques(estimate missing values based on the values of surrounding data points.):
        df[i].interpolate(method='linear')
        df[i].interpolate(method='quadratic')
        +Advantages: Preserves Data Relationships
        -Disadvantages: Complexity, Assumptions on Data may not always be true


Outliers Detection:
    -Z-Score Method(detects outliers based on how far a data point is from the mean, measured in terms of standard deviations.):
        z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df))
        outliers_z = np.where(z_scores > 3)
        +Pros: Simple, fast, works well with normally distributed data.
        -Cons: Not reliable for skewed or non-normal distributions.
    -IQR Method (Interquartile Range) (Any value that falls below Q1 − 1.5 × IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 × IQR is considered an outlier.):
        Q1 = df.quantile(0.25)
        Q3 = df.quantile(0.75)
        IQR = Q3 - Q1
        outliers_iqr = ((df < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))
        +Pros: Robust to non-normal data, less influenced by extreme values.
        -Cons: Doesn’t adapt well to very skewed distributions.
    -Isolation Forest(Randomly select features and split values.Construct isolation trees. Compute average path length for each point. Shorter path = more likely outlier.):
        +Pros: Works well in high dimensions, efficient.
        -Cons: Requires choosing contamination
    -Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (If a point has significantly lower density than its neighbors, it is flagged as an outlier.):
        +Pros: Works well with clusters of varying density.
        -Cons: Sensitive to choice of k (neighbors).
