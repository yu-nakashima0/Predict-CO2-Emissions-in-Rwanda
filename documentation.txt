1. Data Collection

2. Data Exploration/Processing
-> there were missing values
    -> filled with interpolate(linear)
-> outlier Detection
    -> IsolationForest
-> data normalization
-> Handling Skewed Distribution


3. Data Visualization(streamlit/plotly)
- Boxplot 
- Correlation 
- Feature importance
- mutual information
